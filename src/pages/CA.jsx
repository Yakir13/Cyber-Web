        <h1>Cyber Attack</h1>
        <p>A cyber attack is a malicious attempt to breach or damage a computer system, network, or electronic device. These attacks can have various motivations, including theft, data manipulation, service disruption, or political reasons. Here are some common types of cyber attacks with examples:</p>
        <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>A method where attackers deceive individuals into providing sensitive information by masquerading as legitimate entities.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>An email appearing to be from a bank asks the recipient to verify their account details by clicking on a link that leads to a fraudulent website.</p>
        <h2>Ransomware</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>Malicious software that encrypts a user's files or locks them out of their system, demanding a ransom for restoration.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 affected thousands of computers worldwide, encrypting files and demanding payment in Bitcoin to unlock them.</p>
        <h2>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>An attack that overwhelms a server, service, or network with a flood of internet traffic, making it unavailable to users.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>The 2016 Dyn DDoS attack disrupted services for major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit by overwhelming the DNS provider with traffic.</p>
        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b> Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer system or network.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>The MyDoom virus, which spread via email attachments, was one of the fastest-spreading email worms and caused significant damage in the early 2000s.</p>
        <h2>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>An attacker intercepts communication between two parties, often to steal data or manipulate messages.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>In an unsecured Wi-Fi network, an attacker could intercept and alter communications between a user and a website, capturing sensitive information like passwords.</p>
        <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>A code injection technique where an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into a query, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>In 2009, the Heartland Payment Systems breach was linked to an SQL injection attack that compromised millions of credit card records.</p>
        <h2>Credential Stuffing</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>An attack where stolen account credentials from one service are used to gain access to accounts on other services.
        <br /><b>Example - </b>Following data breaches, attackers use lists of usernames and passwords to access user accounts on popular platforms, such as social media or online banking.</p>
        <h2>Zero-Day Exploit</h2>
        <p><b>Description - </b>An attack that occurs on the same day a vulnerability is discovered and before it is patched
        <br /><b>Example - </b>The Stuxnet worm, which targeted Iranâ€™s nuclear program, exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows.</p>
        <br /><p>Cyber attacks can have serious consequences, including financial loss, data breaches, and reputational damage, underscoring the importance of cybersecurity measures.</p>
