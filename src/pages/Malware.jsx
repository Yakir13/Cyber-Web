            <h1>What is Malware</h1>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, network, or client. It can take many forms, including viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware, each with unique behaviors and damage capabilities: <br /> <br />
            1. <b>Viruses</b> spread and corrupt files, slowing down or crashing your systems. <br />
            2. <b>Worms</b> autonomously replicate and spread over networks, exploiting vulnerabilities. <br />
            3. <b>Trojan</b> horses disguise themselves as legitimate software to steal information or harm the system. <br />
            4. <b>Ransomware</b> locks or encrypts your data, demanding payment for access. <br />
            5. <b>Spyware</b> secretly observes the user's activities and collects personal information. <br /> <br />
            Understanding and preventing malware is crucial for protecting personal and organizational data. Ensure your systems are secure by using up-to-date antivirus software, maintaining firewalls, and educating yourself on the signs of malware.</p>
