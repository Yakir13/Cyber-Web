        <h1>Cybersecurity </h1>
        <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computers, networks, software, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It involves the implementation of various technologies, processes, and practices designed to defend against a wide range of threats, such as:</p>
        <p>1. <b>Malware - </b>Malicious software that can harm systems, steal data, or extort money.
        <br />2. <b>Phishing - </b>Fraudulent attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
        <br />3. <b>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - </b>Overloading a system to make it inaccessible.
        <br />4. <b>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) - </b>Intercepting and altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.
        <br />5. <b>Zero-Day Exploits - </b>Taking advantage of software vulnerabilities that haven't been patched yet.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity encompasses various practices, including encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, secure coding, and regular updates, all aimed at minimizing risks and ensuring the safety of digital information.</p>
        <h1>Information security</h1>
        <p>Information security (InfoSec) refers to the practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It focuses on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (often referred to as the CIA triad) of data, whether it's stored electronically, on physical media, or transmitted across networks.</p>
        <h2>Key Principles of Information Security</h2>
        <p>1. <b>Confidentiality - </b>Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it, preventing unauthorized disclosure.
        <br />2. <b>Integrity - </b>Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information by preventing unauthorized modification.
        <br />3. <b>Availability - </b>Ensuring that authorized users have reliable access to information and resources when needed.</p>
        <h2>Common Information Security Practices</h2>
        <p>1. <b>Access Control - </b>Restricting access to data and systems based on user roles and permissions.
        <br />2. <b>Encryption - </b>Using algorithms to encode data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
        <br />3. <b>Network Security - </b>Protecting data as it travels across networks through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure communication protocols.
        <br />4. <b>Incident Response - </b>Establishing protocols to respond quickly to security breaches to minimize damage.
        <br />5. <b>Risk Management - </b>Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with the handling of sensitive data. </p>
        <p>While closely related to cybersecurity, information security encompasses a broader scope that includes physical security measures, policy management, and data governance practices, in addition to digital protections.</p>
