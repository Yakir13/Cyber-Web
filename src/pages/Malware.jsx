            <h1>What Is Malware</h1>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, network, or client. It can take many forms, including viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware, each with unique behaviors and damage capabilities: <br /> <br />
            1. <b>Viruses - </b>spread and corrupt files, slowing down or crashing your systems. <br />
            2. <b>Worms - </b>autonomously replicate and spread over networks, exploiting vulnerabilities. <br />
            3. <b>Trojan horses - </b>disguise themselves as legitimate software to steal information or harm the system. <br />
            4. <b>Ransomware - </b>locks or encrypts your data, demanding payment for access. <br />
            5. <b>Spyware - </b>secretly observes the user's activities and collects personal information. <br />
            6. <b>Adware - </b>Displays unwanted advertisements, sometimes bundled with spyware. <br />
            7. <b>Rootkits - </b>Tools that give unauthorized users control over a system while hiding their presence. <br />
            8. <b>Botnets - </b>Networks of infected computers used for launching cyberattacks or other malicious activities without the owners' knowledge. <br /> <br />
            Malware can enter systems through various methods such as email attachments, downloads from malicious websites, or vulnerabilities in software. Once installed, it can cause damage like stealing sensitive data, spying on users, or disrupting system operations.</p>
            <h1>How To Defense</h1>
            <h2>1. Install and Update Security Software</h2>
            <p>1. Antivirus Software - Use reputable antivirus or antimalware software to scan and remove malware.</p>
            <p>2. Firewalls - Enable firewalls to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic for malicious activity.</p>
            <p>3. Anti-Ransomware Tools - Some tools are specifically designed to detect and block ransomware attacks.</p>
            <h2>2. Keep Your Software Updated</h2>
            <p>1. Regularly update your operating system, browsers, and applications to patch security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.</p>
            <p>2. Enable automatic updates to ensure you always have the latest security patches.</p>
            <h2>3. Practice Safe Browsing Habits</h2>
            <p>1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from unknown or untrusted websites.</p>
            <p>2. Be cautious of email attachments or links from untrusted sources, especially those with unsolicited offers or urgent messages.</p>
            <p>3. Use a secure browser and enable built-in security features like blocking pop-ups or warning about unsafe websites.</p>
            <h2>4. Strengthen Passwords and Authentication</h2>
            <p>1. Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts, and change them regularly.</p>
            <p>2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, especially for sensitive accounts.</p>
            <p>3. Use a password manager to store and manage complex passwords securely.</p>
            <h2>5. Backup Your Data Regularly</h2>
            <p>Create regular backups of important files to offline storage or secure cloud services. This can help you recover your data in case of a ransomware attack or other malware incidents.</p>
            <h2>6. Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions</h2>
            <p>1. Use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to encrypt your connection when using public Wi-Fi to prevent attackers from intercepting your data.</p>
            <p>2. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (like banking or email) over unsecured networks.</p>
